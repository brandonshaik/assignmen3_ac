# What a Trump Presidency Means for Immigrant Youth

In June 2012 the Obama Administration passed an Executive Action called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), a policy which provides a renewable two-year work permit and exemption from deportation to individuals who entered the U.S. illegally before their sixteenth birthday and before June 2007. The policy does not provide a pathway to citizenship for these individuals but it does provide non-immigrant legal status.

Donald Trump has promised his supporters that, should he be elected, he will end the program - deporting hundreds of thousands of college students and children
